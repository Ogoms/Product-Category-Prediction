# **Product Category Prediction**
This project aims to predict the category of a product based on other features using machine learning techniques.

## **Overview**
Product-Category-Prediction is a Python-based machine learning project that leverages supervised learning algorithms to predict the category of a product. It uses a dataset containing various features of products such as Customer Gender, Quantity, cost, etc., to train machine learning models.

## **Features**
Predicts the category of a product based on input features.
Provides accuracy metrics and evaluation results for model performance.
Includes data preprocessing steps for cleaning and transforming input data.

## **Installation**
Clone the repository: 
https://github.com/Ogoms/Product-Category-Prediction.git

Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

## **Usage**
Navigate to the project directory:
cd Product-Category-Prediction

Activate the virtual environment:
.\venv\Scripts\Activate  # For Windows
source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/Mac
